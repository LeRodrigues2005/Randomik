# A Simple Game

This is a terminal game where you must guess a random number. You will receive a message indicating if the number you chose is too high or too low, until you guess the correct number and win.

## How to Play

1. Run the game in your Visual Studio Code terminal (the IDE I recommend for this game).
2. Guess a number between 1 and 100.
3. You will be told if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. After winning, you can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Requirements

- You must have the .NET SDK installed in Visual Studio Code, as this is an entirely C# application.

## Note

You may see the following warning: `warning CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference.`
However, this will not prevent the game from running correctly.

Enjoy playing!
